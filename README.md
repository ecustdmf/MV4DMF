# Intelligent Droplet Tracking Method for Digital Microfluidics

This project is used to design a target tracker based on correlation filtering theory for real-time positioning and feedback of digital microfluidics.

The code includes the following functions:    
1.  Image pre-processing: perspective transformation, background segmentation;
2.  Detecting the initial position of the droplet;
3.  Tracking of droplet;
4.  Real time information feedback;
